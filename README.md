# Nuxt 3 template - Basic Version

This is a basic template for Nuxt 3. No examples inside, just a clean template.
It is a great starting point for your next project.

## Motivation

So I was looking for a Nuxt 3 template that I could use for my next project. I found a few, but they were either too complex or too simple. I wanted something in the middle. So I decided to create my own template. I hope you find it useful.
